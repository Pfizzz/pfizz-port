* This project uses Browser Router. I was instructed to deploy to Netlify instead of GHPages, as the routing was giving GHPages trouble.
* LIVE LINK: [Netlify](https://6188837693c9010008b79033--trusting-hugle-935210.netlify.app/)

This is my first attempt to create a portoflio using React. Although I was able to make most of the elements responsive, I am interested in deveoping this project further by implementing a CSS framework to make the site function better on smaller screens. Many of the elements, most obviously the resume, are temporary items to fulfill the requirements of the project.

Test push. 2
